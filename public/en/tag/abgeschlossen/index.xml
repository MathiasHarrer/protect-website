&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is one of the most common and serious diseases of our time. Currently, about four million people in Germany suffer from the symptoms, but only a few receive effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet-based forms of treatment can be a possible supplement to classic therapy concepts. These promise a lower uptake threshold, reduced waiting times and help independent of time and place. Numerous studies show that these forms of treatment can be successful in depression. However, not all patients are interested in and/or suitable for a purely internet-supported treatment. Combined procedures that combine psychotherapy on site and internet-supported treatment elements could use the advantages of both approaches and be a promising supplement to classic forms of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this background, the Chair of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the FAU is investigating the effectiveness of such a combined depression treatment (online lessons on website, smartphone app, personal therapy conversations on site in Erlangen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruitment in general practitioners&amp;rsquo; practices within the RCT study took place from February 2015 to August 2016. We are currently not enrolling any more patients in the study. The treatment phase of &amp;ldquo;Moodbuster&amp;rdquo; will be completed in early 2017 for the last patient enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scientific-background&#34;&gt;Scientific background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-COMPARED (European-COMPARative Effectiveness research on online depression) is an interdisciplinary project involving specialists from the fields of psychology, health technology, communication and information technology and health care. The original project period from 01.01.2014 to 31.12.2016 has been extended by another 6 months until 30.06.2017. The project compares the standard treatment of depression in eight European countries with a combination of personal (face-to-face) and web- or mobile-based therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evaluation will use randomized controlled trials (RCT), advanced ICT (information and communication technology) platforms, technological intelligence and an economic prediction model to investigate which form of treatment is more effective, for which patient group and under which conditions. In Germany, the evaluation study was implemented in primary health care and thus in the setting of the outpatient treatment of depressive patients in GP practice. For this purpose, close cooperation with GP practices in the Erlangen-Nuremberg-Fürth metropolitan region took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cooperating-gp-practices-in-the-metropolitan-region-erlangen-nuremberg-fürth&#34;&gt;Cooperating GP practices in the metropolitan region Erlangen-Nuremberg-Fürth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank the GP practices who, as cooperation partners, have been able to support the study and win over their affected patients to participate in the study on the treatment of depressive symptoms. Flyers and posters for the waiting room and the personal doctor-patient consultation were made available to the GPs for the recruitment of patients in the GP practices. The time spent by the general practitioners involved in the study was to be a maximum of 30-60 minutes per patient and was compensated. By participating in the study, family doctors&amp;rsquo; practices are making an important contribution to the further development of depression treatment in Germany. In addition, their patients benefited from a prompt start of treatment; i.e. therapy places were available without waiting time. An overview of the cooperating GP practices can be found

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-research-project-for-depressive-patients-in-family-practice&#34;&gt;The research project for depressive patients in family practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients affected by depressive symptoms could contact their own family doctor&amp;rsquo;s practice, as any family doctor&amp;rsquo;s practice could start a cooperation with us at any time. By answering a health questionnaire (by post or online) patients registered with us and subsequently received further information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conditions-of-participation&#34;&gt;Conditions of participation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who were at least 18 years old and were not undergoing any current psychotherapeutic treatment by psychologists or doctors were eligible to participate in the study. Previous therapeutic experience or an existing or concurrent drug treatment was allowed. Another prerequisite for participation was the diagnosis of major depression (mild, moderate or severe; also chronic courses or relapses). Patients with the diagnosis of a minor depression were referred to a depression prevention study by us. The diagnosis was carried out by our test directors (telephone interview).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to participate in our study, the treating family doctor&amp;rsquo;s practice had to already be a cooperation partner of ours or show willingness to become one. In order to participate in the internet-supported therapy modules, a computer with internet access was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The project was awarded the Erlanger Medizinpreis in 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet-based intervention for major depression in diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 with smartphone support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30% of all diabetes patients suffer from major depression or subclinical depressive symptoms. Meta-analyses prove the effectiveness of internet-based health interventions (IGI) in the area of depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a randomized controlled trial, participants with diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and depressive symptoms (N=352) are assigned to a six-week diabetes-specific Internet-based program for managing depressive symptoms or to a control group (psychoeducation) with unrestricted access to routine care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily text messages and weekly individual feedback by e-mail are intended to increase the adherence of the training. The primary endpoint is the reduction of depressive symptoms. Secondary endpoints include diabetic-specific emotional stress and glycaemic control (HbA1c).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will be assessed after the intervention and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet-based prevention of major depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Depression (MD) is associated with a significant loss of quality of life, increased mortality rates and enormous economic costs. It is estimated that current therapies could reduce the burden of disease attributable to MD at the population level by only one third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preventive services can help reduce the burden of disease caused by MD. The aim of the study is therefore to evaluate an internet-based intervention for the prevention of MD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial (N=420) the (cost-) effectiveness of an internet-based intervention (GET.ON Depression) relative to a control condition (psychoeducation) will be compared to the 12-month catamnesis. The sample includes adults with subclinical depression. GET.ON Depression includes minimal therapeutic support by an online coach. The primary endpoint is the time to onset of a depressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A health economic evaluation from a societal perspective will be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online training for the management of panic disorders with smartphone support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet-based interventions (IBI) to reduce panic and fear have proven to be effective. So far, however, these online programs have not supported the person concerned in practicing new behavioral patterns directly in the fear-inducing situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this purpose we developed GET.ON Panic - an online training based on cognitive behavioral therapy consisting of 6 lessons on psychoeducation, exposure, cognitive restructuring and relapse prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training has been expanded with elements for the smartphone, such as a diary or exposure app. In a 2-arm randomized controlled study, the effects of GET.ON Panic are compared with those of a waiting control group. Participants with subclinical and clinical panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) are included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GET.ON Panic is a promising IBI, which, thanks to smartphone support, starts &amp;ldquo;where the panic happens&amp;rdquo; - namely in the everyday life of those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online regeneration training for better sleep for teachers with high occupational demands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep disorders and work-related stress often occur together and are associated with individual suffering and functional limitations as well as high economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapeutic interventions for insomnia (IKVT-I) have the potential to reduce the existing gap in care and have proven to be effective in many cases. Less is known about the effectiveness of IKVT-I in populations with work-related stress.  Therefore, the aim is to evaluate an IKVT-I training specifically designed for work-related stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a two-armed, randomized controlled study (N = 126) the effects of IKVT-I training (GET.ON Regeneration) are compared to a waiting control condition before, after training and to a 6-month catamnesis. Teachers with clinically significant insomniac complaints and work-related stress reactions are included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GET.ON Regeneration emphasizes, in addition to classic KVT-I elements (e.g. sleep restriction, examination of dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions), the mental distancing from occupational problems and the promotion of recovery activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A health economic evaluation from a societal perspective is carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occupational stress is associated with numerous psychological and emotional problems, such as depression and anxiety, and can have a significant economic cost due to loss of productivity, absenteeism or incapacity to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies prove the effectiveness of traditional face-to-face training; however, it is costly and time-consuming. Online-based interventions to reduce occupational stress counteract these disadvantages, but there is little evidence to date. Persons from the general population who experience occupational stress (N=260) are randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or the 6-month waiting list control group in a randomized controlled trial. Participants will receive weekly feedback from an online coach on each of the 7 training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficacy will be assessed at pre- and post-trial, after 6 months, and as an extended follow-up for the IG after 12 months. Primary outcome is perceived stress. Cost effectiveness is also reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MasterMind project aimed to make high-quality treatment methods for depression more widely available in Europe using internet and technology-based concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression targets a huge disease burden worldwide, which manifests itself in high incidence rates and enormous social costs. Technology-based treatment concepts are well researched and show high efficacy in the treatment of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the project was to evaluate the effectiveness of cCBT (computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy) in more than 10 EU countries within a large-scale project (more than 5,000 patients).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project identified barriers and success factors in the implementation of cCBT in different political, social, and economic contexts, and from the perspective of patients, professionals, and health care providers. On this basis, recommendations were made for the implementation of cCBT at the European level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project ran from 1 March 2014 to 28 February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mastermind-project.eu/scientific-publications/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Publications &amp;amp; Deliverables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;topics-of-the-project&#34;&gt;Topics of the Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equal access to treatment&lt;/strong&gt;: All EU citizens suffering from depression should have equal access to evidence-based treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;: Countries and regions within the EU cooperate to exchange knowledge and optimise treatment processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Health professionals, healthcare providers, and patients are equally involved in the development of good treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-management&lt;/strong&gt;: All patients with depression who are willing and able to do so should be given the chance to manage their mental health themselves with technical support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
