&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development and Evaluation of an online- and mobile based Intervention for adolescents and young adults with PTSD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTSD is a mental disorder, which can occur after witnessing a traumatic event. The disorder can affect  emotional, physical, social as well as academic development. It&amp;rsquo;s concequences can, especially for children, adolescents, and young adults, extend into adulthood. The elevated distress, the possible psychological implications, educational difficulties as well as possible long-term suffering within the disorder can result in a high burden on an individual as well as on a societal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are effective treatments for PTSD in adolescents and young adults, not every person affected receives treatment offering due to structural as well as attitudinal barriers. Internet- and mobile-based interventions can help fill this health care gap. But they do not yet exist for adolescents and young adults so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project StAR aims to fill this research- as well as the health care gap, in developing an internet- and mobile-based Intervention for adolescents and young adults with PTSD and evaluating it in a feasibility study. A subsequent randomized controlled trial aims at determining its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StAR is a subproject in the research association BestForCan. BestForCan aims at disseminating a special psychotherapeutic intervention for children, adolescents, and young adults after child abuse and neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
