&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental disorder prevention with Internet- and telephone-based interventions for persons in the &amp;ldquo;green professions &amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model project &amp;ldquo;Mit uns im Gleichgewicht&amp;rdquo; (In Balance With Us), funded by the Social Insurance for Agriculture, Forestry and Horticulture (SVLFG), aims to promote and maintain mental health among farmers, foresters and horticulturists and is being scientifically evaluated by the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg and the University of Ulm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain and promote the mental health of farmers, foresters and horticulturists, the SVLFG offers the insured persons on-site preventive measures such as seminars on stress management. Within the framework of the model project, these offers will be expanded to include internet and tele-based interventions (online health training by the GET.ON Institute and intensive individual coaching by IVPNetworks). Interventions to prevent mental stress are particularly in demand in agriculture, as this occupational group is exposed to many stressors and strains due to difficult working conditions (e.g. high workload, family conflicts, seasonal work). It has been proven that internet and tele-based interventions can be effective, but the effects at population level depend on the actual use of the target group. With this background, there is a great need for scientifically sound knowledge about the needs of farmers, foresters and horticulturists, their partners and family members working with them, and how these needs can be met effectively. In addition, it should be examined whether target group-specific offers for this group of people can effectively and cost-effectively counteract the development of depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chair of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the FAU, on behalf of SVLFG, is investigating in partly overlapping sub-projects the current use and acceptance of preventive interventions among farmers, gardeners and foresters on the one hand, and the effectiveness of two specific interventions (online-based health training, telemedical intensive care) on the other hand. In addition, the new health services and online-based interventions are being offered to SVLFG insured persons via different access routes as part of a large implementation study throughout Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target group of the project&lt;/strong&gt;
Farmers insured with SVLFG, their co-insured partners and family members&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project duration&lt;/strong&gt;
01.06.2017 – 30.05.2021&lt;/p&gt;
