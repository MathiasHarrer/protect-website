He has raised more than 5 Million € (~ 6 Mio. USD) in funding, and he is a key representative/work package leader in numerous european FP7/H2020-projects concerning the prevention (iCARE, H2020) and treatment of mental disorders (Mastermind, EC FP7, CIP Pilot Actions) and their implementation into routine care.\nFurthermore, Dr. Ebert is President and board of directors member of the International Society for Research on Internet Interventions (ISRII), an international society for digital health intervention acting globally. He also serves as the board of directors member of the German Society for Psychology Health Psychology Group, German Society for Psychology EFPA emissary, founding member and board of directors member of the\n„European Society for Research on Internet Interventions\u0026rdquo; (ESRII), and member of the editorial board for Elsevier\u0026rsquo;s Internet Interventions, and as Associate Editor for BMC Medical Research Methodology.\nBesides his academic activities, Ebert focusses on implementing evidence-based internet- and App-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders into routine care. He thus founded the GET.On Institute, with funds from the European Union. Aim of this transfer institute is to solely implement interventions with an excellent scientific basis into routine care. He also served as head of the scientific innovation department of Schön Clinics, one of the largest private Clinic chains in Germany, where he implemented internet-based psychotherapical treatments into routine care and served as counsellor for firms and clinics with respect to the implementation of online-therapy into routine care.\nDr. Ebert has been awarded numerous national and international prizes and awards, including the Early Career Research Award of the ISRII, the Award of the German Society for Behavior Therapy (DGVT) for innovations in behavior therapy (2014), the 2015 award of the German Society for Psychology Clinical Psychology Group (DGPs), the Charlotte-Karl-Bühler-Award 2016 for his scientific work \u0026ldquo;reaching the status of a comprehensive research program, which has had tremendous impact on psychology and further fields of research\u0026rdquo;, as well as the Comenius Award of the European Federation For Psychologists Association (EFPA).\n\n\nAwards  Comenius Award of the European Federation of Psychologist Association (EFPA) selected from nominations from all european national societies for scientific psychology in Europe 2017 Charlotte- und Karl-Bühler Prize of the German Society for Psychology for the \u0026ldquo;scientific work which has reached the status of a research program and which has already influenced psychology and research fields beyond\u0026rdquo; Young Researcher Award 2015 of the Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy Group of the German Society for Psychology Prize of the German Society for Behavior Therapy (DGVT) for special contributions on the field of behavior therapy, 2014 Grant Personal Mobility EU Erasmus for scientific work at the Free University Amsterdam (Prof. Dr. Pim Cuijpers), October-December 2013 DRV Special Poster Prize 2012 for the study „Web-basierte Nachsorge: nur was für junge und hoch gebildete Rehabilitanden?

There is currently no laboratory test for this disorder, so patients often have to wait years for a diagnosis. During this time they do not receive the treatment and support they need. For this reason, we are developing a molecular test based on \u0026ldquo;Blood Spots\u0026rdquo; (i.e. dried drops of blood on filter paper). Such a test can provide an early and accurate diagnosis for patients with depression and help to get further assistance quickly. We measure the concentration of over 100 proteins in the dried blood drops. To do this, we use a technique called mass spectrometer analysis. The results of the study will be published. ​\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation ","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"fd92f23107feed6749a56d4c4346767b","permalink":"/en/project/dried-blood-spots/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/dried-blood-spots/","section":"project","summary":"Identification of Depression Biomarkers","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"Dried Blood Spots","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ingrid Titzler, MSc DiplKommWirt PP"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Depression is one of the most common and serious diseases of our time. Currently, about four million people in Germany suffer from the symptoms, but only a few receive effective treatment.\nInternet-based forms of treatment can be a possible supplement to classic therapy concepts. These promise a lower uptake threshold, reduced waiting times and help independent of time and place. Numerous studies show that these forms of treatment can be successful in depression. However, not all patients are interested in and/or suitable for a purely internet-supported treatment. Combined procedures that combine psychotherapy on site and internet-supported treatment elements could use the advantages of both approaches and be a promising supplement to classic forms of therapy.\nAgainst this background, the Chair of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the FAU is investigating the effectiveness of such a combined depression treatment (online lessons on website, smartphone app, personal therapy conversations on site in Erlangen).\nRecruitment in general practitioners\u0026rsquo; practices within the RCT study took place from February 2015 to August 2016. We are currently not enrolling any more patients in the study. The treatment phase of \u0026ldquo;Moodbuster\u0026rdquo; will be completed in early 2017 for the last patient enrolled.\n Scientific background E-COMPARED (European-COMPARative Effectiveness research on online depression) is an interdisciplinary project involving specialists from the fields of psychology, health technology, communication and information technology and health care. The original project period from 01.01.2014 to 31.12.2016 has been extended by another 6 months until 30.06.2017. The project compares the standard treatment of depression in eight European countries with a combination of personal (face-to-face) and web- or mobile-based therapy.\nThe evaluation will use randomized controlled trials (RCT), advanced ICT (information and communication technology) platforms, technological intelligence and an economic prediction model to investigate which form of treatment is more effective, for which patient group and under which conditions. In Germany, the evaluation study was implemented in primary health care and thus in the setting of the outpatient treatment of depressive patients in GP practice. For this purpose, close cooperation with GP practices in the Erlangen-Nuremberg-Fürth metropolitan region took place.\n Cooperating GP practices in the metropolitan region Erlangen-Nuremberg-Fürth We would like to thank the GP practices who, as cooperation partners, have been able to support the study and win over their affected patients to participate in the study on the treatment of depressive symptoms. Flyers and posters for the waiting room and the personal doctor-patient consultation were made available to the GPs for the recruitment of patients in the GP practices. The time spent by the general practitioners involved in the study was to be a maximum of 30-60 minutes per patient and was compensated. By participating in the study, family doctors\u0026rsquo; practices are making an important contribution to the further development of depression treatment in Germany. In addition, their patients benefited from a prompt start of treatment; i.e. therapy places were available without waiting time. An overview of the cooperating GP practices can be found here.\n The research project for depressive patients in family practice Patients affected by depressive symptoms could contact their own family doctor\u0026rsquo;s practice, as any family doctor\u0026rsquo;s practice could start a cooperation with us at any time. By answering a health questionnaire (by post or online) patients registered with us and subsequently received further information.\n Conditions of participation Patients who were at least 18 years old and were not undergoing any current psychotherapeutic treatment by psychologists or doctors were eligible to participate in the study. Previous therapeutic experience or an existing or concurrent drug treatment was allowed. Another prerequisite for participation was the diagnosis of major depression (mild, moderate or severe; also chronic courses or relapses). Patients with the diagnosis of a minor depression were referred to a depression prevention study by us. The diagnosis was carried out by our test directors (telephone interview).\nIn order to participate in our study, the treating family doctor\u0026rsquo;s practice had to already be a cooperation partner of ours or show willingness to become one. In order to participate in the internet-supported therapy modules, a computer with internet access was necessary.\nThe project was awarded the Erlanger Medizinpreis in 2017.\n Funding European Union\n","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"417cc6fdc038f6b70ef9c1383291d5b7","permalink":"/en/project/e-compared/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/e-compared/","section":"project","summary":"Blended Psychotherapy, combination of Internet-, App- and face-to-face psychotherapy","tags":["Abgeschlossen"],"title":"E-Compared","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sandra Schlicker, DiplPsych PP"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Effectiveness of a guided web-based intervention for the treatment of depression and back pain during incapacity to work.\nBack pain and depression are among the number one common diseases and are enormously stressful for those affected. Depression usually affects all areas of the patient\u0026rsquo;s life: thinking, feelings, actions, body and relationships with other people. And because it is precisely with this disease that it is so difficult to make the decision to seek help, even though the drive to change something is lacking, it is extremely important to take a new path.\nThat is why an online training has been developed for people who have back pain, suffer from depressive symptoms, are currently on sick leave, and want to work on improving their mood. The following questions will be examined:\n Is Get.Back effective for back pain patients with depression compared to standard treatment? Is Get.Back cost effective for back pain patients with depression compared to standard treatment? Which factors moderate the effect of Get.Back?  Based on a two-arm, pragmatic, randomized controlled study, Get.Back aims to investigate a web-based depression intervention. Get.Back includes modules for behavioral activation, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, physical activation and relapse prevention. The program is developed for weekly treatment over a total period of nine weeks and includes stwo booster sessions two and four months after the end of treatment.\nPrimary study outcome is depression severity at end of intervention. Secondary outcomes are: Depression remission, quality of life, pain intensity, pain-related limitation, pain-related self-efficacy, work capacity, adherence and satisfaction with the intervention, and intervention costs.\nOutlook: The present effectiveness study focuses on disability due to back pain and depression as the most common health conditions associated with high life expectancy and health care costs.\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation  BARMER\n","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"a4c4808efee5739074915cbddec16fef","permalink":"/en/project/get-back/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/get-back/","section":"project","summary":"eHealth for depression, back pain and sick leave","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"Get.Back","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dr. Anna-Carlotta Zarski","Kiona Weisel, MSc","Marvin Franke, MSc"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Mental stress is not uncommon.

Within the framework of the model project, these offers will be expanded to include internet and tele-based interventions (online health training by the GET.ON Institute and intensive individual coaching by IVPNetworks). Interventions to prevent mental stress are particularly in demand in agriculture, as this occupational group is exposed to many stressors and strains due to difficult working conditions (e.g. high workload, family conflicts, seasonal work). It has been proven that internet and tele-based interventions can be effective, but the effects at population level depend on the actual use of the target group. With this background, there is a great need for scientifically sound knowledge about the needs of farmers, foresters and horticulturists, their partners and family members working with them, and how these needs can be met effectively. In addition, it should be examined whether target group-specific offers for this group of people can effectively and cost-effectively counteract the development of depressive disorders.\nThe Chair of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the FAU, on behalf of SVLFG, is investigating in partly overlapping sub-projects the current use and acceptance of preventive interventions among farmers, gardeners and foresters on the one hand, and the effectiveness of two specific interventions (online-based health training, telemedical intensive care) on the other hand.

Problematic Internet usage can relate to computer games, social networks, but also to online sex, online shopping and online gambling. Where is the line between everyday use and problematic use? Problematic behavior begins when affected persons have an irresistible desire for the respective activities. Their thoughts and emotions are massively influenced by online offers.\nPeople who use the Internet excessively begin to lose control over their use and, if they are denied access, withdrawal symptoms may occur. This can manifest itself, for example, in restlessness, nervousness or depressive mood. Tolerance can also develop and other important areas of life can be affected. Problematic Internet use thus has negative consequences in various areas. One may no longer pay attention to a healthy lifestyle or experience losses in professional or academic areas of life.\n Study Participation\n Funding\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"927023eee60c14d2dadf08fed6439721","permalink":"/en/project/geton-offline/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/geton-offline/","section":"project","summary":"Online Program for Problematic Internet Usage","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"Get.On Offline","type":"project"},{"authors":["Assoc.

In order to improve existing offers, the StudiCare panel regularly surveys undergraduate students at the Friedrich-Alexander-University and the University of Ulm about their mental well-being from the first semester onwards.\nBackground College is a new stage of life in which students make the transition from adolescence to adulthood. This transition period is characterized by joyful experiences as well as new, stressful situations. These include, for example, looking for one\u0026rsquo;s own apartment, organizing finances and studies, finding new friends, getting used to a new environment, exam stress, etc. In the course of their studies, students are not only confronted with this new situation, but may also experience crises. In combination with possible risk behaviors, such as excessive consumption of alcohol or cannabis, this can lead to exhaustion, psychosomatic complaints, anxiety and depressive disorders.\nStudiCare Panel The web-based panel survey is conducted in numerous countries worldwide as part of the WHO The World Mental Health Survey Initiative under the coordination of Harvard University among students from the first semester onwards. The aim of the survey is to obtain information on the mental health of students as well as on risk and protective factors for emotional stress during their undergraduate studies. In addition, more information on the willingness and barriers to using psychosocial interventions and counseling services will be collected. With information from the surveys, the need for help and support services will be assessed, existing counseling services will be improved and new online-based interventions tailored to the individual needs of students will be developed.\nStudiCare Online Health Trainings The online health training courses from StudiCare are low-threshold structured self-help training courses. These trainings can improve the well-being of students and alleviate complaints in a wide variety of areas. They can be used independently of time and place, can be optimally integrated into the individual daily routine and can be conducted anonymously. In the training courses, students manage their complaints independently by working through numerous modules. Modules are based on cognitive-behavioral techniques that are also used in conventional psychotherapy. Essential here are various practical exercises such as relaxation techniques, protocols for self-observation and the integration of small exercises into everyday life (\u0026ldquo;tiny task\u0026rdquo;). These help to reduce negative behavior and build up positive behavior. In the course of the project, new trainings are continuously being developed that deal with topics that are relevant for students. The newly developed online health trainings will be examined in randomized clinical studies to evaluate their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.\n Training Participation\nEvidence-based methods for promoting mental health among students: Series of meta-analytical reviews In order to derive appropriate measures, a comprehensive assessment of the current evidence base of psychosocial support services is necessary. In a series of meta-analytical reviews, the current knowledge about effective psychological treatment and prevention services including their effectiveness is collected and critically examined. Psychological interventions and their effectiveness are examined with regard to specific disorder areas (e.g. anxiety symptoms, eating disorders, sleep disorders, suicidal tendencies) or intervention methods (e.g. internet-based procedures, \u0026ldquo;third wave\u0026rdquo; procedures). Along with clinical effectiveness, special attention is devoted to the influence of interventions on the academic impairment of students.\n Promotion \u0026amp; Cooperation BARMER, Bergische Universität Wuppertal, European Union, FernUniversität in Hagen, FOM University, Harvard Medical School, Leuphana University of Lüneburg, Minddistrict, RWTH Aachen University, University Jaume I, University of Ulm, University of Zurich, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, World Health Organization\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d6e6e4de0babbc26e51cca99ab1f3a3e","permalink":"/en/project/studicare/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/studicare/","section":"project","summary":"Mental Health Promotion in College Students","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"StudiCare","type":"project"},{"authors":["RP Auerbach","P Mortier","R Bruffaerts","J Alonso","C Benjet","P Cuijpers","..."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6096b4b915992e0d5bedba8af1465bef","permalink":"/en/publication/19-1-world-health-organization-world-mental-health-surveys-international-college-student-project-wmh-ics-prevalence-and-distribution-of-mental-disorders/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/19-1-world-health-organization-world-mental-health-surveys-international-college-student-project-wmh-ics-prevalence-and-distribution-of-mental-disorders/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"19.1 World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys International College Student Project (WMH-ICS)- Prevalence and Distribution of Mental Disorders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Assoc.
