Unfortunately, individuals with both CBP and recurrent MDD are underidentified. Utilizing health care insurance data may provide a possibility to better identify this complex population. In addition, internet- and mobile-based interventions might enhance the availability of existing treatments and provide help to those highly burdened individuals.\nObjective: This pilot randomized controlled trial investigated the feasibility of recruitment via the health records of a German health insurance company. The study also examined user satisfaction and effectiveness of a 9-week cognitive behavioral therapy and Web- and mobile-based guided self-help intervention Get.Back in CBP patients with recurrent MDD on sick leave compared with a waitlist control condition.\nMethods: Health records from a German health insurance company were used to identify and recruit participants (N=76) via invitation letters. Study outcomes were measured using Web-based self-report assessments at baseline, posttreatment (9 weeks), and a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was depressive symptom severity (Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression); secondary outcomes included anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life), pain-related variables (Oswestry Disability Index, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and pain intensity), and negative effects (Inventory for the Assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy).\nResults: The total enrollment rate with the recruitment strategy used was 1.26% (76/6000). Participants completed 4.8 modules (SD 2.6, range 0-7) of Get.Back. The overall user satisfaction was favorable (mean Client Satisfaction Questionnaire score=24.5, SD 5.2). Covariance analyses showed a small but statistically significant reduction in depressive symptom severity in the intervention group (n=40) at posttreatment compared with the waitlist control group (n=36; F1,76=3.62, P=.03; d=0.28, 95% CI −0.17 to 0.74). Similar findings were noted for the reduction of anxiety symptoms (F1,76=10.45; P=.001; d=0.14, 95% CI −0.31 to 0.60) at posttreatment. Other secondary outcomes were nonsignificant (.06≤P≤.44). At the 6-month follow-up, the difference between the groups with regard to reduction in depressive symptom severity was no longer statistically significant (F1,76=1.50, P=.11; d=0.10, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.46). The between-group difference in anxiety at posttreatment was maintained to follow-up (F1,76=2.94, P=.04; d=0.38, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.83). There were no statistically significant differences across groups regarding other secondary outcomes at the 6-month follow-up (.08≤P≤.42).\nConclusions: These results suggest that participants with comorbid depression and CBP on sick leave may benefit from internet- and mobile-based interventions, as exemplified with the positive user satisfaction ratings. The recruitment strategy via health insurance letter invitations appeared feasible, but more research is needed to understand how response rates in untreated individuals with CBP and comorbid depression can be increased.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"735b1c1184cc4ba0a5c4feb2ba49652d","permalink":"/en/publication/a-web-and-mobile-based-intervention-for-comorbid-recurrent-depression-in-patients-with-chronic-back-pain-on-sick-leave-get-back-pilot-randomized-controlled-trial-on-/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/a-web-and-mobile-based-intervention-for-comorbid-recurrent-depression-in-patients-with-chronic-back-pain-on-sick-leave-get-back-pilot-randomized-controlled-trial-on-/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Chronic back pain (CBP) is linked to a higher prevalence and higher occurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and can lead to reduced quality of life.

The meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials that examined apps for the treatment of adults with increased symptoms of mental disorder compared to a control group. A total of 19 studies with 3681 participants were found with apps to improve depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol consumption, smoking, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorder and self-harming thoughts and behaviors.\nThe results showed that smartphone apps had only small effects on depression and smoking behavior, whereas there were no effects on anxiety, self-harming thoughts and behaviors and alcohol consumption. Individual studies with apps for post-traumatic stress disorder were also not effective, while large effects were found in two individual studies on sleep problems.\nApps have enormous potential, but the current study situation is sobering. The approach must be fundamentally distinguished from web-based treatment formats for mental illness, for which numerous studies show that they can have great effects on a wide range of mental illnesses, many of which are even comparable with those of conventional health care services such as pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy.\nThe conclusion: Smartphone apps cannot be recommended as a stand-alone treatment for mental disorders on the basis of the current evidence.

There is currently no laboratory test for this disorder, so patients often have to wait years for a diagnosis. During this time they do not receive the treatment and support they need. For this reason, we are developing a molecular test based on \u0026ldquo;Blood Spots\u0026rdquo; (i.e. dried drops of blood on filter paper). Such a test can provide an early and accurate diagnosis for patients with depression and help to get further assistance quickly. We measure the concentration of over 100 proteins in the dried blood drops. To do this, we use a technique called mass spectrometer analysis. The results of the study will be published. ​\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation ","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"fd92f23107feed6749a56d4c4346767b","permalink":"/en/project/dried-blood-spots/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/dried-blood-spots/","section":"project","summary":"Identification of Depression Biomarkers","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"Dried Blood Spots","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ingrid Titzler, MSc, DiplKommWirt, PP"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Depression is one of the most common and serious diseases of our time. Currently, about four million people in Germany suffer from the symptoms, but only a few receive effective treatment.\nInternet-based forms of treatment can be a possible supplement to classic therapy concepts. These promise a lower uptake threshold, reduced waiting times and help independent of time and place. Numerous studies show that these forms of treatment can be successful in depression. However, not all patients are interested in and/or suitable for a purely internet-supported treatment. Combined procedures that combine psychotherapy on site and internet-supported treatment elements could use the advantages of both approaches and be a promising supplement to classic forms of therapy.\nAgainst this background, the Chair of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the FAU is investigating the effectiveness of such a combined depression treatment (online lessons on website, smartphone app, personal therapy conversations on site in Erlangen).\nRecruitment in general practitioners\u0026rsquo; practices within the RCT study took place from February 2015 to August 2016. We are currently not enrolling any more patients in the study. The treatment phase of \u0026ldquo;Moodbuster\u0026rdquo; will be completed in early 2017 for the last patient enrolled.\n Scientific background E-COMPARED (European-COMPARative Effectiveness research on online depression) is an interdisciplinary project involving specialists from the fields of psychology, health technology, communication and information technology and health care. The original project period from 01.01.2014 to 31.12.2016 has been extended by another 6 months until 30.06.2017. The project compares the standard treatment of depression in eight European countries with a combination of personal (face-to-face) and web- or mobile-based therapy.\nThe evaluation will use randomized controlled trials (RCT), advanced ICT (information and communication technology) platforms, technological intelligence and an economic prediction model to investigate which form of treatment is more effective, for which patient group and under which conditions. In Germany, the evaluation study was implemented in primary health care and thus in the setting of the outpatient treatment of depressive patients in GP practice. For this purpose, close cooperation with GP practices in the Erlangen-Nuremberg-Fürth metropolitan region took place.\n Cooperating GP practices in the metropolitan region Erlangen-Nuremberg-Fürth We would like to thank the GP practices who, as cooperation partners, have been able to support the study and win over their affected patients to participate in the study on the treatment of depressive symptoms. Flyers and posters for the waiting room and the personal doctor-patient consultation were made available to the GPs for the recruitment of patients in the GP practices. The time spent by the general practitioners involved in the study was to be a maximum of 30-60 minutes per patient and was compensated. By participating in the study, family doctors\u0026rsquo; practices are making an important contribution to the further development of depression treatment in Germany. In addition, their patients benefited from a prompt start of treatment; i.e. therapy places were available without waiting time. An overview of the cooperating GP practices can be found here.\n The research project for depressive patients in family practice Patients affected by depressive symptoms could contact their own family doctor\u0026rsquo;s practice, as any family doctor\u0026rsquo;s practice could start a cooperation with us at any time. By answering a health questionnaire (by post or online) patients registered with us and subsequently received further information.\n Conditions of participation Patients who were at least 18 years old and were not undergoing any current psychotherapeutic treatment by psychologists or doctors were eligible to participate in the study. Previous therapeutic experience or an existing or concurrent drug treatment was allowed. Another prerequisite for participation was the diagnosis of major depression (mild, moderate or severe; also chronic courses or relapses).

Depression usually affects all areas of the patient\u0026rsquo;s life: thinking, feelings, actions, body and relationships with other people. And because it is precisely with this disease that it is so difficult to make the decision to seek help, even though the drive to change something is lacking, it is extremely important to take a new path.\nThat is why an online training has been developed for people who have back pain, suffer from depressive symptoms, are currently on sick leave, and want to work on improving their mood. The following questions will be examined:\n Is Get.Back effective for back pain patients with depression compared to standard treatment? Is Get.Back cost effective for back pain patients with depression compared to standard treatment? Which factors moderate the effect of Get.Back?  Based on a two-arm, pragmatic, randomized controlled study, Get.Back aims to investigate a web-based depression intervention. Get.Back includes modules for behavioral activation, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, physical activation and relapse prevention. The program is developed for weekly treatment over a total period of nine weeks and includes stwo booster sessions two and four months after the end of treatment.\nPrimary study outcome is depression severity at end of intervention. Secondary outcomes are: Depression remission, quality of life, pain intensity, pain-related limitation, pain-related self-efficacy, work capacity, adherence and satisfaction with the intervention, and intervention costs.\nOutlook: The present effectiveness study focuses on disability due to back pain and depression as the most common health conditions associated with high life expectancy and health care costs.\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation  BARMER\n","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"a4c4808efee5739074915cbddec16fef","permalink":"/en/project/get-back/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/get-back/","section":"project","summary":"eHealth for depression, back pain and sick leave","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"Get.Back","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dr. Anna-Carlotta Zarski","Kiona Weisel, MSc","Marvin Franke, MSc"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Mental stress is not uncommon. Many people suffer from low spirits, worries, fears, or feel a general sense of dissatisfaction.\nThe 7-week online training ICare Prevent provides help in dealing with such feelings and offers background information on how they arise. In addition, the training aims to improve mental well-being and reduce mental discomfort through systematic training of helpful and proven strategies such as problem solving and activity planning to strengthen important areas of everyday life.\nThe online training ICare Prevent is currently being evaluated in a multicenter study in cooperation with universities in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain and Austria.\nICare Prevent is part of the EU-funded Horizon 2020 program, which has set itself the goal of developing, implementing and evaluating online training for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in order to improve existing care structures, open new access routes and overcome implementation barriers.\n Project Coordination Under the direction of Dr. David Ebert, Prof. Dr. Thomas Berger and PD Dr. Michael Schaub, one focus of our research at the Chair of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy (KliPs) at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and at the Universities of Bern and Zurich is the development and scientific investigation of online programs in various areas, such as depression, anxiety disorders, stress management, sleep disorders, alcohol abuse and procrastination.\n Promotion \u0026amp; Cooperation ICare Prevent is a cooperation project within the framework of the ICare - Integrating Technology into Mental Health Care Delivery in Europe project. ICare Prevent received funding within the Horizon2020 research and innovation program of the European Union (Grant agreement No 634757).\nThe ICare project aims to establish an innovative, comprehensive mental health care delivery model in Europe. It combines evidence-based prevention, early detection and treatment of common mental disorders via a common online platform. In cooperation with established health care providers, ICare will complement or be integrated into existing services in order to avoid and reduce long-term costs caused by mental illness.\nThe project partners come from a total of six European countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Great Britain, Netherlands, Spain). All project partners have many years of research experience in the field of e-mental health. Together they can present a portfolio of more than 30 evidence-based online programmes for the promotion of mental health and for prevention, self-help, treatment and aftercare of mental illness.\nFurther information can be found here.\n \n","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"e7a1a088dfb0c0fbb27f227f5366b8cd","permalink":"/en/project/icare-prevent/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/icare-prevent/","section":"project","summary":"Internet and mobile-based prevention of depression and anxiety disorders","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"ICare Prevent","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ingrid Titzler, MSc, DiplKommWirt, PP","Janika Thielecke, MSc","Dr. Claudia Buntrock","Johanna Freund, MSc"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Mental disorder prevention with Internet- and telephone-based interventions for persons in the \u0026ldquo;green professions \u0026ldquo;\nThe model project \u0026ldquo;Mit uns im Gleichgewicht\u0026rdquo; (In Balance With Us), funded by the Social Insurance for Agriculture, Forestry and Horticulture (SVLFG), aims to promote and maintain mental health among farmers, foresters and horticulturists and is being scientifically evaluated by the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg and the University of Ulm.\nIn order to maintain and promote the mental health of farmers, foresters and horticulturists, the SVLFG offers the insured persons on-site preventive measures such as seminars on stress management. Within the framework of the model project, these offers will be expanded to include internet and tele-based interventions (online health training by the GET.ON Institute and intensive individual coaching by IVPNetworks). Interventions to prevent mental stress are particularly in demand in agriculture, as this occupational group is exposed to many stressors and strains due to difficult working conditions (e.g. high workload, family conflicts, seasonal work). It has been proven that internet and tele-based interventions can be effective, but the effects at population level depend on the actual use of the target group. With this background, there is a great need for scientifically sound knowledge about the needs of farmers, foresters and horticulturists, their partners and family members working with them, and how these needs can be met effectively. In addition, it should be examined whether target group-specific offers for this group of people can effectively and cost-effectively counteract the development of depressive disorders.\nThe Chair of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the FAU, on behalf of SVLFG, is investigating in partly overlapping sub-projects the current use and acceptance of preventive interventions among farmers, gardeners and foresters on the one hand, and the effectiveness of two specific interventions (online-based health training, telemedical intensive care) on the other hand. In addition, the new health services and online-based interventions are being offered to SVLFG insured persons via different access routes as part of a large implementation study throughout Germany.\nTarget group of the project Farmers insured with SVLFG, their co-insured partners and family members\nProject duration 01.06.2017 – 30.05.2021\n","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"79c6b5484c6d81f4d803935864d59589","permalink":"/en/project/mit-uns-im-gleichgewicht/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/mit-uns-im-gleichgewicht/","section":"project","summary":"Prevention of mental disorders in farmers and gardeners","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"In Balance With Us","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dr. Anna-Carlotta Zarski"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Paivina-Care is an online-based self-help training that is specially designed to meet the needs of women with Genito-Pelvic Pain-Penetration Disorder.

The aim of the study is therefore to evaluate an internet-based intervention for the prevention of MD.\nMethods: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial (N=420) the (cost-) effectiveness of an internet-based intervention (GET.ON Depression) relative to a control condition (psychoeducation) will be compared to the 12-month catamesis.

Problematic Internet usage can relate to computer games, social networks, but also to online sex, online shopping and online gambling. Where is the line between everyday use and problematic use? Problematic behavior begins when affected persons have an irresistible desire for the respective activities. Their thoughts and emotions are massively influenced by online offers.\nPeople who use the Internet excessively begin to lose control over their use and, if they are denied access, withdrawal symptoms may occur. This can manifest itself, for example, in restlessness, nervousness or depressive mood. Tolerance can also develop and other important areas of life can be affected. Problematic Internet use thus has negative consequences in various areas. One may no longer pay attention to a healthy lifestyle or experience losses in professional or academic areas of life.\n Study Participation\n Funding\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"927023eee60c14d2dadf08fed6439721","permalink":"/en/project/geton-offline/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/geton-offline/","section":"project","summary":"Online Program for Problematic Internet Usage","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"Get.On Offline","type":"project"},{"authors":["Prof. Dr. David Daniel Ebert","Dr. Claudia Buntrock","Johanna Freund, MSc"],"categories":null,"content":"Projektbeschreibung In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten wurden große Anstrengungen in die Entwicklung, Testung und Implementation von eHealth für eine weite Bandbreite von Gesundheitsproblemen, im körperlichen wie im psychischen Bereich gesetzt.\nNichtsdestotrotz schaffen es wenige Interventionen in die Routinebehandlung, oder benötigen viele Jahre auf dem Weg dahin.\nImpleMentAll (IMA) zielt darauf ab, durch die Entwicklung, Anwendung und Evaluation maßgeschneiderter Implementationsstrategien in einem natürlichen Labor derzeitiger eHealth-Implementationsintiviativen in der EU und darüber hinaus eine evidenzbasierte Antwort auf dieses Problem zu geben.\nDie Forschung des Projektes baut dabei auf vorhergegangenen internationalen Projekten auf (z.B.

MSc"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Mental Health Promotion in College Students StudiCare includes various online training courses for the prevention and treatment of mental illness, tailored to the needs of college students. In order to improve existing offers, the StudiCare panel regularly surveys undergraduate students at the Friedrich-Alexander-University and the University of Ulm about their mental well-being from the first semester onwards.\nBackground College is a new stage of life in which students make the transition from adolescence to adulthood. This transition period is characterized by joyful experiences as well as new, stressful situations. These include, for example, looking for one\u0026rsquo;s own apartment, organizing finances and studies, finding new friends, getting used to a new environment, exam stress, etc. In the course of their studies, students are not only confronted with this new situation, but may also experience crises. In combination with possible risk behaviors, such as excessive consumption of alcohol or cannabis, this can lead to exhaustion, psychosomatic complaints, anxiety and depressive disorders.\nStudiCare Panel The web-based panel survey is conducted in numerous countries worldwide as part of the WHO The World Mental Health Survey Initiative under the coordination of Harvard University among students from the first semester onwards. The aim of the survey is to obtain information on the mental health of students as well as on risk and protective factors for emotional stress during their undergraduate studies. In addition, more information on the willingness and barriers to using psychosocial interventions and counseling services will be collected. With information from the surveys, the need for help and support services will be assessed, existing counseling services will be improved and new online-based interventions tailored to the individual needs of students will be developed.\nStudiCare Online Health Trainings The online health training courses from StudiCare are low-threshold structured self-help training courses. These trainings can improve the well-being of students and alleviate complaints in a wide variety of areas. They can be used independently of time and place, can be optimally integrated into the individual daily routine and can be conducted anonymously. In the training courses, students manage their complaints independently by working through numerous modules. Modules are based on cognitive-behavioral techniques that are also used in conventional psychotherapy. Essential here are various practical exercises such as relaxation techniques, protocols for self-observation and the integration of small exercises into everyday life (\u0026ldquo;tiny task\u0026rdquo;). These help to reduce negative behavior and build up positive behavior. In the course of the project, new trainings are continuously being developed that deal with topics that are relevant for students. The newly developed online health trainings will be examined in randomized clinical studies to evaluate their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.\n Training Participation\nEvidence-based methods for promoting mental health among students: Series of meta-analytical reviews In order to derive appropriate measures, a comprehensive assessment of the current evidence base of psychosocial support services is necessary. In a series of meta-analytical reviews, the current knowledge about effective psychological treatment and prevention services including their effectiveness is collected and critically examined. Psychological interventions and their effectiveness are examined with regard to specific disorder areas (e.g. anxiety symptoms, eating disorders, sleep disorders, suicidal tendencies) or intervention methods (e.g. internet-based procedures, \u0026ldquo;third wave\u0026rdquo; procedures). Along with clinical effectiveness, special attention is devoted to the influence of interventions on the academic impairment of students.\n Promotion \u0026amp; Cooperation BARMER, Bergische Universität Wuppertal, European Union, FernUniversität in Hagen, FOM University, Harvard Medical School, Leuphana University of Lüneburg, Minddistrict, RWTH Aachen University, University Jaume I, University of Ulm, University of Zurich, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, World Health Organization\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d6e6e4de0babbc26e51cca99ab1f3a3e","permalink":"/en/project/studicare/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/studicare/","section":"project","summary":"Mental Health Promotion in College Students","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"StudiCare","type":"project"},{"authors":["JJF Breedvelt","Y Amanvermez","Mathias Harrer, MSc","E Karyotaki","S Gilbody","..."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"aff05e6c43ce4d07b54244cc53e02fd9","permalink":"/en/publication/the-effects-of-meditation-yoga-and-mindfulness-on-depression-anxiety-and-stress-in-tertiary-education-students-a-meta-analysis/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/the-effects-of-meditation-yoga-and-mindfulness-on-depression-anxiety-and-stress-in-tertiary-education-students-a-meta-analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The effects of meditation  yoga  and mindfulness on depression  anxiety  and stress in tertiary education students- A meta-analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Breedvelt","Y Amanvermez","Mathias Harrer, MSc","E Karyotaki","S Gilbody","..."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"01d75cfe31411c52e7c7c520b6bacb49","permalink":"/en/publication/the-effects-of-meditation-yoga-and-mindfulness-on-depression-anxiety-and-stress-in-tertiary-education-students-a-meta-analysis/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/the-effects-of-meditation-yoga-and-mindfulness-on-depression-anxiety-and-stress-in-tertiary-education-students-a-meta-analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The effects of meditation  yoga and mindfulness on depression  anxiety and stress in tertiary education students- A meta-analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Reis","D Lehr","E Heber","Prof. Dr. David Daniel Ebert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d58d27755c3d2bbe19dadab9d8e6bd73","permalink":"/en/publication/the-german-version-of-the-perceived-stress-scale-pss-10-evaluation-of-dimensionality-validity-and-measurement-invariance-with-exploratory-and-confirmatory-bifactor-modeling/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/the-german-version-of-the-perceived-stress-scale-pss-10-evaluation-of-dimensionality-validity-and-measurement-invariance-with-exploratory-and-confirmatory-bifactor-modeling/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The German version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)- evaluation of dimensionality  validity  and measurement invariance with exploratory and confirmatory bifactor modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JA Reins","L Boß","D Lehr","M Berking","Prof. Dr. David Daniel Ebert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"7477ae6c7a701392a775c1f73ce56d18","permalink":"/en/publication/the-more-i-got-the-less-i-need-efficacy-of-internet-based-guided-self-help-compared-to-online-psychoeducation-for-major-depressive-disorder/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/the-more-i-got-the-less-i-need-efficacy-of-internet-based-guided-self-help-compared-to-online-psychoeducation-for-major-depressive-disorder/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The more I got  the less I need?

Patients, according to Eysenck, are often better off after some time had passed, even without treatment -psychotherapy is thus ascribed a healing effect that is not caused by it. In short, Eysenck\u0026rsquo;s assessment was that psychotherapy is ineffective, even preventing improvement in some cases.\n Psychotherapy is generally considered an effective procedure The development of the randomized controlled trial, which compares treated patients with an untreated control group, and meta-analysis, in which many studies are mathematically summarized, attempted to address Eysencks allegation. Since then, on the basis of such methods, there has been a perceived certainty that psychotherapy, in contrast to Eysenck\u0026rsquo;s allegation, is indeed effective, as a very large decrease in, for example, depressive symptoms has been found in treated versus untreated groups.\n Was Eysenck right after all? A recent paper by Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Reijnders and Ebert (2018) curbs this enthusiasm about meta-analytic findings on the effectiveness of psychotherapy for depression and addresses the question of whether Eysenck might have been right. In particular, the authors argue that much of the evidence on the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression is distorted by so-called bias, that is systematic errors or artifacts in randomized controlled trials that make the effectiveness of psychotherapy shine in a much brighter light than is actually the case.\nBias can be caused by many factors. When new drugs are developed and evaluated, they are usually compared to a so-called placebo: Patients do not know if they are given a pill with or without an active ingredient. Often, a placebo effect is also found: simply by the fact that patients believe they take an effective drug improves their symptoms, even if it is a sugar pill with no active ingredient.\nThis placebo effect is also of particular importance for psychotherapy research: Patients in psychotherapy studies know exactly whether they are receiving the therapeutic treatment studied or if they are in the control condition. Because patients in the treatment condition expect an effective treatment, this placebo effect alone could improve their symptoms without the treatment itself being significant. On the other hand, patients in the control group know that they are not expected to see any real improvement, which has a negative effect on the alleviation of their symptoms, as these patients often do not change their behavior until they receive treatment after the study has ended. This is just one of many types of bias that might cause psychotherapy to be considered much more effective than it actually is.\n Findings The study by Cuijpers and colleagues therefore attempted to analyze how the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression decreases when controlling for all types of bias. It turned out that for all types of psychotherapy the overall effects decreased heavily. The effectiveness of therapies for depression was overestimated for a long time. It turned out, however, that despite the control of all possible systematic errors, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) still yielded positive results. For psychodynamic procedures, this was not the case, although not even all forms of bias could be controlled for. For other procedures, such as interpersonal therapy, there have been too few studies to make accurate statements.\nThis analysis shows that Eysenck\u0026rsquo;s verdict must be taken very seriously, albeit being probably incorrect for very well empirically grounded procedures. More accuracy and more precise research methods are needed to truly ensure the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic approaches.\n","date":1541894400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541894400,"objectID":"d9cd122fe13bb18a382370c53b02cd6d","permalink":"/en/post/eysenck/","publishdate":"2018-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/eysenck/","section":"post","summary":"About 65 years ago, German-British psychologist Hans-Jürgen Eysenck (1916-1997) caused a great stir with a paper in which he questioned the effectiveness of psychotherapy.

Meta-analyses prove the effectiveness of internet-based health interventions (IGI) in the area of depressive disorders.\nIn a randomized controlled trial, participants with diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and depressive symptoms (N=352) are assigned to a six-week diabetes-specific Internet-based program for managing depressive symptoms or to a control group (psychoeducation) with unrestricted access to routine care.\nDaily text messages and weekly individual feedback by e-mail are intended to increase the adherence of the training. The primary endpoint is the reduction of depressive symptoms. Secondary endpoints include diabetic-specific emotional stress and glycaemic control (HbA1c).\nProgram effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will be assessed after the intervention and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation BARMER\n","date":1455494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1455494400,"objectID":"8fd2fc1a5f430349ff4af2accffeeda6","permalink":"/en/project/geton-diabetes/","publishdate":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/geton-diabetes/","section":"project","summary":"Supportive Intervention for Depression and Diabetes","tags":["Abgeschlossen"],"title":"Get.On Diabetes","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dr. Claudia Buntrock"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Internet-based prevention of major depression\nMajor Depression (MD) is associated with a significant loss of quality of life, increased mortality rates and enormous economic costs.

Online-based interventions to reduce occupational stress counteract these disadvantages, but there is little evidence to date.
