## Health Economic Analyses

**In the research focus Health Economics, the PROTECT Lab deals with the following key questions:**

* To what extent are existing health care resources used effectively and efficiently?

* How can health care services be evaluated from a health economic perspective and assessed for their effectiveness and efficiency?

* What contribution can health economic evaluation make to transfer care services (for example, behavioral health interventions) to the statutory health insurance system?

To answer these questions, we primarily apply economic analyses that are conducted in conjunction with efficacy studies (e.g., randomized controlled efficacy studies) known as trial-based economic evaluations. More than 20 such projects have been / are being carried out. In cases where the observation period of the study is not sufficient for a well-founded assessment or other comparative interventions are interesting, we rely on modeling that can be used to attempt to close these knowledge gaps.

## What is Health Economics?

Health economics provides opportunities for comparative assessment of diagnostic, preventive or therapeutic procedures in terms of their effectiveness and costs.

The aim is to use existing resources in such a way that the supply is effectively improved, taking into account the costs occuring thereby. Thus, health care decisions can be made on an evidence-based basis and considerations of advantages and disadvantages of alternatives can be made.Here, the perspectives relevant stakeholders, patients, health insurance companies as well as the service providers can be taken into account. Overall, when interpreting the results of empirical studies, medical as well as economic and ethical aspects must be considered.
