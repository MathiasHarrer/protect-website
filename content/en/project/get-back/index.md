## Project Description

**Effectiveness of a guided web-based intervention for the treatment of depression and back pain during incapacity to work.**

Back pain and depression are among the number one common diseases and are enormously stressful for those affected. Depression usually affects all areas of the patient's life: thinking, feelings, actions, body and relationships with other people. And because it is precisely with this disease that it is so difficult to make the decision to seek help, even though the drive to change something is lacking, it is extremely important to take a new path.

 That is why an online training has been developed for people who have back pain, suffer from depressive symptoms, are currently on sick leave, and want to work on improving their mood. The following questions will be examined:


- Is Get.Back effective for back pain patients with depression compared to standard treatment?
- Is Get.Back cost effective for back pain patients with depression compared to standard treatment?
- Which factors moderate the effect of Get.Back?

Based on a two-arm, pragmatic, randomized controlled study, Get.Back aims to investigate a web-based depression intervention. Get.Back includes modules for behavioral activation, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, physical activation and relapse prevention. The program is developed for weekly treatment over a total period of nine weeks and includes stwo booster sessions two and four months after the end of treatment.

Primary study outcome is depression severity at end of intervention. Secondary outcomes are: Depression remission, quality of life, pain intensity, pain-related limitation, pain-related self-efficacy, work capacity, adherence and satisfaction with the intervention, and intervention costs.

Outlook: The present effectiveness study focuses on disability due to back pain and depression as the most common health conditions associated with high life expectancy and health care costs.
