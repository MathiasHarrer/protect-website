## Project Description

**Development and Evaluation of an online- and mobile based Intervention for adolescents and young adults with PTSD.**

PTSD is a mental disorder, which can occur after witnessing a traumatic event. The disorder can affect  emotional, physical, social as well as academic development. It's concequences can, especially for children, adolescents, and young adults, extend into adulthood. The elevated distress, the possible psychological implications, educational difficulties as well as possible long-term suffering within the disorder can result in a high burden on an individual as well as on a societal level.

Although there are effective treatments for PTSD in adolescents and young adults, not every person affected receives treatment offering due to structural as well as attitudinal barriers. Internet- and mobile-based interventions can help fill this health care gap. But they do not yet exist for adolescents and young adults so far.

The project StAR aims to fill this research- as well as the health care gap, in developing an internet- and mobile-based Intervention for adolescents and young adults with PTSD and evaluating it in a feasibility study. A subsequent randomized controlled trial aims at determining its efficacy.

StAR is a subproject in the research association BestForCan. BestForCan aims at disseminating a special psychotherapeutic intervention for children, adolescents, and young adults after child abuse and neglect.
