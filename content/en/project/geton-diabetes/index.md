## Project Description

**Internet-based intervention for major depression in diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 with smartphone support**

About 30% of all diabetes patients suffer from major depression or subclinical depressive symptoms. Meta-analyses prove the effectiveness of internet-based health interventions (IGI) in the area of depressive disorders.

In a randomized controlled trial, participants with diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and depressive symptoms (N=352) are assigned to a six-week diabetes-specific Internet-based program for managing depressive symptoms or to a control group (psychoeducation) with unrestricted access to routine care.

Daily text messages and weekly individual feedback by e-mail are intended to increase the adherence of the training. The primary endpoint is the reduction of depressive symptoms. Secondary endpoints include diabetic-specific emotional stress and glycaemic control (HbA1c).

Program effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will be assessed after the intervention and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.
