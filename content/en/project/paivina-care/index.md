## Project Description

Paivina-Care is an online-based self-help training that is specially designed to meet the needs of women with Genito-Pelvic Pain-Penetration Disorder. The training is offered free of charge as part of a scientific study at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU).

Genito-Pelvic Pain-Penetration Disorder is also known as vaginismus or dyspareunia. Women with Genito-Pelvic Pain-Penetration Disorder suffer from difficulties and pain during vaginal insertion, so that sexual intercourse is no longer possible for them.

Genito-Pelvic Pain-Penetration Disorder is a combination of two different diagnoses of female sexual dysfunction. The new diagnosis includes both symptoms of sexual pain disorder (dyspareunia) and penetration disorder (vaginismus).
