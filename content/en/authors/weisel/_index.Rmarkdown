# Information

<font size="3">

Kiona Weisel studied Business Psychology (B.Sc.) with a minor in Digital Media and Cultural Informatics at the Leuphana University Lüneburg. After her bachelor's degree she completed a master's degree (M.Sc.) in Information Technology and Cognition at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. The focus of her master's degree was on the practical application of data analysis to large data sets using machine learning techniques in Python, computational linguistics and cognitive science. In the second year of her master's degree she worked as a research assistant in the Valuation and Social Decision Making Group of Dr. Jan Gläscher at the Institute of Systemic Neuroscience at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Her tasks included the execution and data collection of social experiments on decision behaviour, the preparation of MRI experiments and the evaluation of experimental data with Matlab.

She became interested in the interface between digitization and psychology at an early stage and began a doctoral position in the field of digital health at the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 2015. The research focus of her PhD is on trends and developments in internet-based and mobile-based interventions for mental health. Since the end of 2015, Kiona Weisel has been working as a research assistant in the EU-funded consortium project ICare "Integrating Technology into Mental Health Care Delivery in Europe". In her position as co-principal investigator she is responsible for the planning, conduction and evaluation of randomized controlled trials in the field of transdiagnostic prevention and treatment of anxiety disorders and depression.

Kiona Weisel has already presented her research work at international and national congresses: European Society for Research on Internet Interventions (ESRII), International Society for Research on Internet Interventions (ISRII), German Society for Psychology (DGPs).
