Depressive disorders are widespread, associated with severe individual suffering and cause high costs to society as a whole. For some time now, researchers have been increasingly concerned with the question of how depression can not only be treated effectively, but can also be prevented beforehand through appropriate intervention formats. In this context, the Protect Lab is investigating the role digital interventions can play in the prevention of depression.
